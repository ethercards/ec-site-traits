    have three. Most Limited Edition Traits will have the ability to
    level up.

    assigned randomly to cards. Some cards will have lots of these

    none.
- title: Conditional Traits
  desc: Conditional Traits generally have a set value and are only applied
    to cards that meet the conditional requirements.
