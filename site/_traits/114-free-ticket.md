## Free Ticket

![icon](/assets/images/trait-icons/{{page.image}})

This trait gives you a free ticket to any raffle that takes place on the Ether Cards platform.

The Ether Cards platform enables customizable gamifications for dynamic sales. The platform will launch with raffles, set-completion games, blind bags, and mystery boxes. Ether Cards will be doing its own raffles and partner projects will be able to launch raffles for collections they create on the platform and other items. When the gamification platform is fully developed, anyone will be able to host a customizable raffle of their own. Terms and conditions apply.
