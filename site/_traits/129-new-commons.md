*This Trait was proposed by @Empath Acrobat as part of our first community Trait creation contest.*

With this trait, you can reroll the “common” layers on your accidental artwork(s). You are then presented with the option of keeping your current layer or using the rerolled one.

Each First Edition Ether Card features a 5-layered “accidental collaboration” piece. We commissioned 15 artists to each design a set of layers. Other layers called “commons” feature the Ether Cards diamond. We then combined these using Chainlink VRF to produce unique combinatory artworks. Cards with all 5 layers by a single artist, or “Perfects” are some of the most rare and have traded at high premiums. Each combination creates its own vibe. Each vibe is a coordinate in the Ether Cards universe.
