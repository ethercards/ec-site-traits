*This Trait was proposed by @SaArbitrage as part of our first community Trait creation contest.* 

Ether Cards are indeed like a flock of birds who lay golden eggs. They fly through the skies of the whole cryptosphere, connecting to a network of benefits that grows with each partner project. With the Golden Goose Trait, your card becomes one of the most rare birds of all, since there are only 25 of these. The wallet holding this card becomes a nest that fills with golden eggs when EtherCards holds Blind Bag events on the gamification platform. With the Golden Goose Trait, you get a Blind Bag for free every time. 

Blind Bags are an event type on the gamification platform. They are “sealed” packs that use Chainlink VRF to provide a randomized mix of cards. Like getting packs of trading cards at a shop, you never know where the most valuable ones will turn up. Participants pay a fee to open them – unless Golden Goose drops you a Blind Bag for free.
