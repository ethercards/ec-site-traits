## Swap

![icon](/assets/images/trait-icons/{{page.image}})

*This Trait was proposed by @booyah2 as part of our first community Trait creation contest.* 

With Swap, you can swap your card for a randomly selected card in the vault of the same type (e.g. Founder for Founder, Alpha for Alpha, OG for OG). This will only be available, of course, as long as there are cards in the vault.
