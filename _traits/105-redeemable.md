## Redeemable

![icon](/assets/images/trait-icons/{{page.image}})

This trait will be redeemable for a physical item in the real world. Plans are still underway, but so far what we know is that it will be something special.

The Ether Cards platform offers tools for connecting NFTs to the real world. This can come in the form of responsive NFTs that change based on real-world actions, admission passes to real-world events, redeemable traits like this one and other customizable features. With the Redeemable trait, youâ€™ll be among the first people in the world to experience this new application.
