## Synthesis Ritual

![icon](/assets/images/trait-icons/{{page.image}})

This Trait was proposed by @PipsquEECS as part of our first community Trait creation contest.

On the Ether Cards Explorer, you can view the entire set of Ether Cards First Edition Cards in a grid. With Synthesis ritual, you can select layers from any adjacent card’s accidental collaboration artwork and copy them onto the layers on your card. This does not affect the card(s) from which you copy the layer(s), but replaces the layer(s) on your card with the selected layer(s).

On the back of each card (and on the front of Founders) is at least one 5-layered “accidental collaboration” piece. Ether Cards commissioned 15 artists to each design a set of layers. Other layers called “commons” feature the Ether Cards diamond. These layers were then combined using Chainlink VRF to produce unique combinatory artworks. Cards with all 5 layers by a single artist, or “Perfects” are some of the most rare and have traded at high premiums. Each combination creates its own vibe. Each vibe is a coordinate in the Ether Cards universe.
