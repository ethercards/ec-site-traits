![icon](/assets/images/trait-icons/{{page.image}})

*This Trait was proposed by @Eskalexia as part of our first community Trait creation contest.*

Each time this card changes wallets (through being traded on OpenSea or otherwise transferred), one Randomized Edition Trait changes to a different Randomized Edition Trait.
