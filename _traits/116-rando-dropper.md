Rando Dropper drops a Randomized Edition Trait onto your card. This Trait changes every month to a different Random Edition Trait. You can burn Rando Dropper to keep the trait that gets dropped on your card permanently. This can turn an otherwise limited-use Random Edition Trait into a lifetime trait.

Ether Cards uses Chainlink VRF (verifiable random function) to achieve the difficult task of generating randomness on blockchain. Randomization comes into play for raffles, blind bags and other features on the gamification platform as well as in some traits like Rando Dropper.
