## Lucky Reroll

![icon](/assets/images/trait-icons/{{page.image}})

All cards will be able to do a Randomized Edition Trait reroll that removes the current traits and gives a new randomized set of traits. Lucky Reroll gives the card the same chances of getting random traits as an OG when it does a reroll, which means 3x the chances of getting traits and a guarantee of at least 3 traits.
