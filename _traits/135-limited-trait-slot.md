## Limited Trait Slot

![icon](/assets/images/trait-icons/{{page.image}})

This is a placeholder Trait assigned to all cards. Limited Traits can only be assigned to empty Slots. Founders have one slot, Alphas have two slots, and OGs have three slots by default. Cardholders will soon be able to assign a Limited Trait to each slot.
