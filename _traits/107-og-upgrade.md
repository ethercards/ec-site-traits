## OG Upgrade

![icon](/assets/images/trait-icons/{{page.image}})

This trait lets you upgrade a Founder or Alpha card into an OG. When you use this Trait, the Ether Cards team will select an OG card out of the vault and deliver it to you in exchange for your Founder or Alpha card.

There are 4 levels in the Ether Cards First Edition Series: Founders (9000), Alphas (900), OGs (90) and Creators (10). Each of the levels multiplies the benefits of holding a card like Dust collection, number of Traits, special drops and other features.
