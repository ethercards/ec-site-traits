Warp Rabbit is an experiment in randomization. Every time Warp Rabbit is used, it jumps to a different card and takes on a new shape. Warp Rabbit might emerge with Randomized Edition Trait benefits, it might drop Dust onto a card, or it might be a portal for an artwork airdrop. Maybe it will drop an “arsonist” Trait onto your card if you use the Forge. Maybe it will hang out on your card for a while and simply leap away.
