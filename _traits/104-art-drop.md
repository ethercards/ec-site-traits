## Art Drop

![icon](/assets/images/trait-icons/{{page.image}})

Have you every woken up and discovered that an NFT has been dropped into your wallet for free? This trait is an NFT artwork airdrop portal, and it means that youâ€™ll be getting surprises from Ether Cards collaborators. Our First Edition artists include some heavy-hitters, and new artists who join the project will be on the roster for sending artworks to Art Drop holders. The Ether Cards platform provides a set of tools for artists to easily fundraise and sell their works with customizable gamifications as well as to create artworks with dynamic features and real-world interactivity. As new artists join us, their works can start dropping through the Art Drop portal as well.
