## Forge Protector

![icon](/assets/images/trait-icons/{{page.image}})

Deep in the dark bowels of Mount Ether Cards, there lies a room that rings with the clash of metal and rock. Billowing heat from its heart like a living dragon, the Forge can be a dangerous place, unless you have this trait to serve as your shield.

The Forge is one of Ether Cards’ utility developments for NFTs. It enables whole NFTs as well as Traits to be combined and reconfigured. First Edition Ether Cards holders can combine their cards to select desired layers and Traits, forging a new version of their card. The cost… is to sacrifice the other card – unless you have this trait. Forge Protector gives you the ability to use the Forge without sacrificing any cards.
