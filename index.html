    <p>
      Many of these TraitEther Cards NFTs contain a large variety of Traits
      which provide cardholders benefits for both the digital and physical
      world. Traits can be broken up into three categories: Limited Edition,
      Random Edition, and Conditional Traits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Limited Edition Traits are the most valuable and powerful Traits, in as
      much as they will never expire and will never be offered again in the same
      capacity. Users can select which Trait(s) they would like to assign to
      their Limited Trait Slots. Founder Cards have one slot, Alphas have two,
      and OGs have three. Most Limited Edition Traits will have the ability to
      level up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Random Edition Traits vary in their benefits and value, and are assigned
      randomly to cards. Some cards will have lots of these Traits, while others
      may only contain one or in some rare cases, none.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conditional Traits generally are set in their value and are only applied
      to cards that meet the conditional requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of these Traits can be applied to other card series developed by
      Ether Cards partners and clients.
