            <p>Many of these TraitEther Cards NFTs contain a large variety of Traits which provide cardholders benefits for both the digital and physical world. Traits can be broken up into three categories: Limited Edition, Random Edition, and Conditional Traits.</p>
            <p>Limited Edition Traits are the most valuable and powerful Traits, in as much as they will never expire and will never be offered again in the same capacity. Users can select which Trait(s) they would like to assign to their Limited Trait Slots. Founder Cards have one slot, Alphas have two, and OGs have three. Most Limited Edition Traits will have the ability to level up.</p>
            <p>Random Edition Traits vary in their benefits and value, and are assigned randomly to cards. Some cards will have lots of these Traits, while others may only contain one or in some rare cases, none.</p>
            <p>Conditional Traits generally are set in their value and are only applied to cards that meet the conditional requirements.</p>
            <p>Many of these Traits can be applied to other card series developed by Ether Cards partners and clients.</p>
