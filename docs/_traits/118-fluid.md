## Fluid

![icon](/assets/images/trait-icons/{{page.image}})

*This Trait was proposed by @Sonic as part of our first community Trait creation contest.* 

With the Fluid Trait, your card becomes as changeable as the moon. Once a month, you can reroll all of the layers that make up the accidental collaboration artwork on your card (and maybe your traits, too). 

Each First Edition Ether Card features a 5-layered “accidental collaboration” piece. We commissioned 15 artists to each design a set of layers. Other layers called “commons” feature the Ether Cards diamond. We then combine these using Chainlink VRF to produce unique combinatory artworks. Cards with all 5 layers by a single artist, or “Perfects” are some of the most rare and have traded at high premiums. Each combination creates its own vibe. Each vibe is a coordinate in the Ether Cards universe.
