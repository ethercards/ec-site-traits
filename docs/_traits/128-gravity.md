summary: A card with the Gravity Trait attracts cards that are sacrificed in the Forge and other items that are floating around the Ether Cards universe. A randomized function determines the trajectory of the Gravity trait, and if it comes close enough to an item, it falls into your card. As your card attracts more items, its mass grows and the force of its Gravity becomes stronger. The goal is to evolve your Gravity card into a supermassive black hole that sucks up more and more with its irresistible force.

## Gravity

![icon](/assets/images/trait-icons/{{page.image}})

*This Trait was proposed by @scropiomoon as part of our first community Trait creation contest.*

@scorpiomoon describes Gravity like this:
Is gravity the universal glue? Einstein thought everything is relative. In E=mc², is gravity the equalizer, multiplier, square – or the result of all operations together in unison?

Maybe gravity begins as a flutter of excitement. One card recognizes and attracts another from a distance (d=rt).  A seemingly weak and insignificant force of nature. As the relationship forges, more cards, items, abilities are attracted. Over time, as the card attracts more relationships, the force strengthens. Gravity is no longer a single card, but a cluster of cards like a solar system. The cosmic forge continues to construct galaxies of systems and so on and so forth. Superclusters, black holes and finally supermassive black holes. Perhaps there are triggering events like Event Horizons. The culmination of the phenomenon may become so heavy that the gravity collapses upon itself and in doing so gives birth to an entirely new creation.

Gravity has immense responsibility to the natural smart contracts of the metaverse.  Does it attract things from outside the Etherverse?  It may be the weakest of the four fundamental interactions of physics and/or it may make everything possible to exist.
